## Core features

YumeBox MD3 keeps the core capabilities of the original project while continuing to improve the UI, configuration workflow, proxy runtime, and stability:

- **Material Design 3 / Material You**: the main UI is mostly migrated to MD3, with dynamic colors, dark-theme adaptation, navigation bar and Topbar blur effects, smoother motion, and more consistent components.
- **Override and configuration management**: supports multi-configuration switching, stacked applying, visual editing, preset routing templates, runtime configuration preview, and modifiers such as `start`, `end`, `merge`, and `force`.
- **Proxy runtime and node management**: supports Root Tun, Rule / Global / Direct modes, single-node and proxy-group delay tests, node sorting, node tags, icon/flag display, and persistent node selection.
- **Sub-Store, GeoX, and data management**: improves Sub-Store downloads, GeoX data updates, settings backup/restore, app data cleanup, and managed log export.
- **ACG home and Daily Quote**: supports wallpaper, sidebar controls, launch button, runtime information, quote display, manual/daily refresh, and mixed API/custom JSON sources.
- **Statistics, notifications, and stability**: provides connection pages, traffic statistics, service notifications, language and privacy settings, plus ongoing fixes for startup, dialogs, runtime state sync, package size, and background resource release.

## Roadmap

Future work will keep polishing the MD3 experience, configuration editing, runtime status display, traffic statistics, Sub-Store / GeoX flows, and overall stability. Remaining legacy UI boundaries will also be reduced gradually.
